It encompasses a range of attributes, including their marital status, gender, annual income, the number of children in their family, educational attainment, occupation, home ownership status, the count of cars they possess, the distance they commute, regional location, and their age. Moreover, a binary variable indicates whether each individual has made a bike purchase or not.
